// design/Reader.dc.html: the reading page.
//
// IT OWNS A STREAM, NOT A CHAPTER. It used to hold the whole chapter's blocks,
// which is what made a real book unopenable -- Le Fléau's longest chapter is
// 228,849 bytes of them. It holds a ChapterReader instead, which decodes blocks
// from the card as they are wanted and forgets them, so the screen's memory is the
// same for a 1 KB chapter and a 300 KB one.
//
// --- THE PAGE INDEX IS WHAT PAGINATION LEAVES BEHIND -------------------------
//
// One pass over the chapter records the start Cursor of every page -- about 8 bytes
// each, so ~240 bytes for a long chapter -- and discards the lines. That index
// answers the three things a single page cannot:
//
//   * how many pages there are, which the footer's counter needs;
//   * which one this is;
//   * where an earlier one begins.
//
// The pass costs one decode of the chapter, at open. It is the price of being able
// to say "3 / 12" at all.
//
// --- FORWARD IS FREE; BACKWARD RE-DECODES ------------------------------------
//
// A DEFLATE stream cannot be seeked, and checkpointing one costs 32 KB a
// checkpoint. So the reading position keeps its stream and its PageBuilder alive
// and TURNING FORWARD CONTINUES THEM -- the common case, and it costs one page of
// layout. Going back, or jumping, rewinds and decodes forward to the target: ~100
// to 300 ms on device against a ~520 ms panel refresh.

 public:
  // A BOOK, not a chapter. `fs` and `body` must outlive the screen.
  //
  // It took a single ChapterLocation and could therefore only ever show one chapter
  // of a book -- which the device found immediately: spine entry 0 of a real EPUB is
  // `Cover.html`, one `<img>` and no body text, so it paginated to NOTHING and the
  // panel showed a blank page reading 0/0. Skipping to the first chapter with text
  // would only have moved the dead end to the bottom of that chapter.
  //
  // The screen is not renderable until setMetrics has been called, exactly as
  // Library is not until setVisibleRows: a page count depends on a column height
  // and onGesture has no framebuffer to ask. Before it, the page is empty and the
  // counter reads 0 -- a readable screen rather than an abort.
