# Encre

From-scratch firmware for the Xteink X4/X3 e-readers (ESP32-C3, e-ink). Built to
have exactly the UI/UX we want, so **design fidelity is a functional
requirement**, not polish.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `core/` | Portable C++20, namespace `reader::`. **No Arduino, ESP or host-OS dependency** — it compiles for macOS and the ESP32 alike. Framebuffer, fonts, text, icons, dither, view-models, themes. |
| `sim/` | Desktop simulator: renders a screen to PNG at exact panel size. Where UI iteration happens. |
| `shell/` | The Arduino layer. Device detection, display bring-up, the paint sequence. The only place that touches `freeink-sdk`. |
| `tools/` | Asset generators (`fontc.py`, `iconc.py`, `embed_font.py`) and the design comparison tool. |
| `design/` | `*.dc.html` design boards — **the source of truth for the UI**. |
| `docs/superpowers/` | The spec, the roadmap, and per-phase implementation plans. |
| `freeink-sdk/` | Submodule. MIT drivers for display/input/SD/battery. Never edit. |

## Commands

```
make test       # build core + run unit and golden tests (this is the fast loop)
make sim        # render Home to build/home.png
make firmware   # build for the ESP32-C3
make fonts      # regenerate the .rfnt type ramp and embedded headers
make icons      # regenerate icon bitmaps from the design boards' SVG
make compare    # design-vs-firmware contact sheet for every screen
```

`make compare COMPARE_ARGS="--only home --export build/overlay"` writes bare
panel-size PNGs for overlaying in a design tool.

CMake uses `file(GLOB ...)`: **re-run `cmake -S . -B build` after adding or
removing a source file**, or it is silently ignored.

## The rule that governs UI work

**A UI change goes into the design HTML first, then the implementation.** Never
only in code, and not the other way round — including when the design itself is
what is wrong (fix the board, then follow it). `make compare` is what keeps them
honest; changing only the implementation silently invalidates it and the goldens
stop meaning anything.

## Hardware facts

- One binary drives both models. **The panel controller varies by production
  batch**, so the firmware must identify the hardware before touching the
  display: I2C fingerprint for X3-vs-X4, board profile select, then a
  display-bus probe that promotes the profile to `XteinkX3Uc8279`. Skipping the
  probe drives a UC8279 with the UC8253 driver: the power-on handshake succeeds
  and the refresh wait then dies at its 30-second timeout.
- The dev device is an **X3 with a UC8279** — 792×528, so a 528×792 portrait
  canvas. The X4 is 800×480 → 480×800. Both are ~220 PPI.
- **Rotation is CCW**, measured. CW renders 180° out. Unverified on X4.
- `pio` is not on PATH: `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio`. The Makefile handles it.
- **Flashing must be run by the user** — the permission classifier blocks it
  from an agent. Give them the command.
- E-ink holds its last image with no power, so **a frozen screen does not mean
  the firmware ran**. It has disguised a crash loop and a bootloader hang as
  "nothing happened". Read the serial log before believing the panel.
- **The SD card shares the display's SPI bus** (X3: MISO 7, CS 12) and
  `SDCardManager` does **no locking** — there is no mutex or semaphore anywhere in
  it. Its only shared-bus handling is in `begin()`, which drives the display CS
  high before probing because a powered, never-deselected panel breaks card
  detection. So **the caller must keep SD traffic off the bus during a panel
  refresh**; a transfer racing a refresh is the kind of fault that looks random.
- `~/encre-device-backup/restore.sh` restores the device to CrossInk.

## Rendering model

Glyph and icon coverage is 2 bpp — 0..3 per pixel — and the framebuffer is
1-bit. How that coverage gets onto the panel is the screen's declared `Fidelity`
(`core/include/reader/refresh.h`), and there are three answers.

**`Fidelity::Mono` — one pass, one waveform, hard threshold. This is what ships,
and it is the default.** `Plane::Bw` inks where coverage ≥ 2 and leaves paper
where it is ≤ 1. No stipple, no grey, no anti-aliasing: chrome is
hard-thresholded 1-bit.

**Why, when 2A-2 measured thresholded chrome as illegible: because the reference
firmware does exactly this, on this glass.** CrossInk (a CrossPoint derivative,
the stock firmware) builds its **UI fonts 1-bit** and only its *reader* fonts
2-bit, and its "Text Anti-Aliasing" setting is read **only** by the EPUB/TXT
reader activities — never by a menu, home, library or settings screen. Its chrome
therefore has no anti-aliasing at all, and it is legible. Compared side by side
on the X3 against our dithered chrome, the hard edge won. What 2A-2 actually
measured was a *px-authored* type ramp that was too small for the panel; the
pt-at-150-DPI ramp fixed that, and every role is now ≥ 21px, where a 2px stem
fully inked is cleaner than a 2px stem inked 5/8 of the way.

Two things the re-bless made concrete, and both are worth knowing before
predicting what thresholding will do:

- **It makes foreground heavier, not lighter.** Coverage 2 is more common than
  coverage 1 on this ramp (3618 px vs 1702 on Home), so thresholding *fills* more
  edge than it *drops*: Home gained 806 pixels of ink. The naive fear — "hard
  1-bit thins the text out" — is backwards here.
- **The exception is a thin diagonal.** `kChevron`'s stroke is mostly
  coverage-1 pixels, so it comes out one notch lighter and much crisper. Diagonals
  are where to look if a mark ever reads too faint.

**`Fidelity::Dithered` — also one pass and one waveform, but stippled.**
`Plane::BwDithered` puts partial coverage through a **dispersed Bayer 4×4**
instead of thresholding it: `cov*16/3 > bayer4(x,y)` inks 5 cells of 16 at
coverage 1 and 10 at coverage 2, keyed on absolute panel coordinates so a mark
and the label beside it share one grid. Full coverage stays solid and zero stays
blank, so **a glyph interior is never stippled** — only its edge is.

It is **implemented, tested and hardware-verified**, and it is not deprecated. It
costs exactly what `Mono` costs, and it is the right answer where a stroke is wide
enough for a stipple to read as tone rather than as grain — Home's 67px `6%`
numeral is the one element on the screen that measurably got worse on `Mono`, its
curves going from smooth to a countable staircase. Chrome ships `Mono` anyway,
because at 21px the same stipple reads as noise on the stroke rather than as a
soft edge, and small type is most of chrome.

**`Fidelity::Grayscale` — three passes plus a rebase, three waveforms.** The
panel shows **four grey levels** from two bit-planes the controller combines;
there is **no 2 bpp framebuffer**, it would not fit, so the screen is drawn
three times into the 1-bit buffer, and a fourth time to rebase the controller
onto a valid B/W baseline afterwards:

| Pass | Emits | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `Plane::Bw` | ink where coverage ≥ 2 | `displayGrayscaleBase` |
| `Plane::Lsb` | bit 0 of coverage | `copyGrayscaleLsbBuffers` |
| `Plane::Msb` | bit 1 of coverage | `copyGrayscaleMsbBuffers` |

**It costs three panel waveforms: 366 + 366 + 156 ms, and 1363 ms for a focus
move measured end to end on the X3**, against one waveform for either one-pass
path. No screen declares it today. It is kept, not deprecated, because it is the
only way to put continuous tone on this glass — Phase 3's question about book
covers and images — and because the sequence was expensive to get right; the
comments in `paintGray()` were each earned by breaking the panel. **Windowed
grayscale is not the escape hatch**: rotation is CCW, so a portrait row band
becomes a full-height landscape column band and every gate line is driven
anyway.

**Rules, fills and dither** have coverage 0 or 3, so they are identical in every
pass — `Bw`, `BwDithered` and all three grayscale planes. That is what makes a
plane bug show up as fringing rather than missing furniture, `test_components.cpp`
pins it for `drawRow`'s hairline and the header band's rule, and it is why each
re-bless of Home — first onto the dithered path, then onto `Mono` — moved **only**
partial-coverage pixels, verified per pixel against the coverage map rather than
by eyeballing totals.

**Icons are not in that set.** All ten shipped marks are 2 bpp
(`core/src/icons.cpp`) because they are generated anti-aliased from the boards, so
they legitimately carry partial coverage at their edges and take whichever
treatment the plane implies. `Icon::bpp == 1` is the opt-in for a mark that wants
hard 1-bit edges, and nothing uses it — it is now redundant for chrome, because
`Plane::Bw` gives every mark hard edges anyway.

**The small round marks are what settled the chrome question.** `kDot`,
`kBattery` and `kBook` are the marks a 4×4 dither serves worst: a 1px rim at
near-constant coverage has no tone to dither, so the Bayer phase just picks which
rim pixels survive, and the mark comes out visibly moth-eaten. On `Mono` the
battery is a clean outline with a solid fill and a solid terminal nub, the book is
an unmistakable two-page spread with a solid spine, and the bullet loses its four
single-pixel whiskers. Thresholding **improved** all three, measurably and
visibly. Same for `kForward`, whose dithered arrowhead was frayed.

**The two dither matrices are deliberately different, and `dither.cpp` says
why** — and `kClustered` still ships, on the cover placeholder, whatever the
screen's fidelity. `kClustered` is for *tints*: the board's cover placeholder is
one round dot repeated on a 4px grid, and dispersing that area into isolated
pixels reads denser and grainier than the blob it is meant to be. `kBayer` is for
*edges*, and is what `Plane::BwDithered` uses — clustering a stroke's edge
coverage would pile the ink against the stroke and read as the stroke thickening,
which is the one thing an anti-aliased edge must not do. Same nominal coverage,
opposite arrangement, opposite jobs.

## Runtime

The interaction runtime is *logic*, so it lives in `core/` and is unit-tested on
the desktop: `PressRecognizer` (input.h), `App` + `Screen` (app.h),
`RefreshPolicy` (refresh.h), `IdleTimer` (power.h). The shell contributes only
what needs hardware — raw button samples, the panel calls, deep sleep.

- **One physical press is exactly one event.** A hold fires `Long` while the
  button is still down; the release then emits nothing. A button *outside* the
  long-press mask fires `Short` on release however long it was held — never
  nothing. And because `tick()` only runs from the main loop, which a gray
  refresh blocks for ~1.5 s, the **release edge classifies the press too**: a
  hold made entirely inside a repaint would otherwise arrive as a `Short`, which
  on a list means opening the item instead of its actions overlay.
- **`InputManager::beginAsync()` cannot support a long press** — it queues press
  edges only, no releases and no durations. `shell/src/input_task.cpp` is its own
  poll loop over `update()`, queuing both edges with a `millis()` timestamp.
  **Only that task may call `update()`**; it owns the edge state.
- **The hint bar's hold ring and the long-press binding read one field** — the
  view-model's `holds` array, via `hintHoldMask()`. So a screen cannot promise a
  hold it has not bound, or bind one with nothing on screen to suggest it. The
  mask follows the top of the stack, so refresh it after every dispatch.
- **Screens declare a `Fidelity` and the default is `Mono`**, so a screen opts
  *in* to a more expensive or more unusual path rather than out of it — nothing
  declares `Dithered` or `Grayscale` today, and the old `Gray` default is what had
  every chrome screen paying 1363 ms a paint by saying nothing. If one ever does
  declare `Grayscale`, `mode=FAST` beside `fidelity=gray` in a `[paint]` line is
  not a contradiction: the grayscale sequence has no differential form, so it
  means the cadence had a fast slot the screen could not use.
- **A screen transition DOES force a FULL refresh, and there is no periodic
  cadence.** `kFullOnTransition = true`, `kFullRefreshEvery =
  RefreshPolicy::kNever`. This is neither the reference firmware's behaviour nor
  the obvious one, so the reasoning matters:
  - CrossInk skips the transition FULL on this panel
    (`ScreenTransitionRefresh::modeFor` returns FULL only for
    `screenChanged && !deviceIsX3()`) and **accepts the ghosting**. That ghosting
    is observable — reported on its settings screen on this device.
  - The distinction is not flash versus no flash. A flash on a **screen change**
    is expected on an e-reader, as Kindle and Kobo do, because a differential
    update there has a whole screen of stale content to ghost through. A flash on
    a **focus move** inside one screen is a defect. Those are separate settings,
    so we take one and not the other.
  - A periodic cadence was tried at 1-in-15 and made things *worse*: it put the
    flash on an arbitrary navigation, which reads as more random than the
    transition flash it replaced. No ghosting has been observed without it, and
    the ink accumulation this project did once see came from a missing grayscale
    settle pass on a path chrome no longer takes.
  - Cost, measured: a transition takes the 693 ms GC waveform against 389 ms for
    the DU, so ~825 ms versus ~520 ms. Focus moves are untouched.
  - Both become Settings rows in 2C; `kFullOnTransition` needs a **new** row on
    the board first (spec §10).
- **`core/include/reader/screens.h` is the one screen catalogue**, shared by the
  simulator and the shell. Two factories would drift, and the drift would be
  invisible because each half keeps passing its own checks.
- **Deep sleep is a chip reset**, so RAM state is lost and the firmware boots
  into Home. Wake is the **power button only**: the six front buttons are
  ADC-ladder bands on GPIO 1/2 and produce no GPIO edge, while power is a real
  GPIO (3, active-LOW). Sleep order is `display.deepSleep()` →
  `PowerManager::powerDownRailsForSleep()` → `deepSleepUntilPowerButton()`. That
  middle call does cut the X3's SD rail (the profile declares
  `sd.powerEnable = 13`), despite the SDK header calling it a no-op on X3/X4.

## Type

Sized in **points at 150 DPI**, CrossPoint's convention: `ppem = pt * 150 / 72`.

| Role | pt | px | Role | pt | px |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Meta400 / Meta500 | 10 | 21 | Body400 / Body500 | 14 | 29 |
| Label400 / Label500 | 11 | 23 | Title700 | 20 | 42 |
| Value500 / Value700 | 12 | 25 | Display700 | 32 | 67 |

Below ~10pt is not legible on this glass, measured. **A role names size AND
weight**; `FontSet::load` refuses to bind a role to an asset built at a
different ppem or weight, so a mis-binding is a boot failure rather than a
silently wrong screen. `core/` never picks its own fonts — the caller supplies a
`FontSet`, which is how device knowledge stays out of the portable layer.

## Invariants worth not relearning

- **Derive from the board's box model; never pin a number the board computes.**
  Three separate defects came from hardcoding a height: the header band (6px
  out), menu rows (content-box 80 + 1px border = 81, compounding a pixel per
  row), and the hint bar's asymmetric padding. `headerBandHeight()` and
  `hintBarHeight()` derive and return their height.
- **Round once.** Positions accumulate in fixed point and round at the end.
  Three truncating divisions put an icon 1.5px low; pre-rounding 2.52px tracking
  to 3 drifted a label ~3px.
- **Fix in the primitives, not the screen.** Every fidelity defect so far was
  found on one screen and belonged in `components.cpp` / `text.cpp` /
  `dither.cpp` / a generator. Special-casing a screen means the next screen
  inherits the bug.
- **Assets are generated from the design, not transcribed.** `iconc.py` reads
  each icon's SVG and size from its named board at generation time. It once held
  copies and silently swallowed a design fix.
- **The hint bar has exactly four slots and is always one line tall**, one slot
  per front button, in hardware order (Back, Confirm, Up, Down). A button with no
  action gets an empty slot. A long-press variant is a **hollow ring after that
  slot's label** — never a second line and never a fifth hint. Two lines were
  tried and rejected: a bar whose height varies by screen moves every list
  stacked above it, and "· HOLD" does not fit four slots at 10pt on the 480-wide
  X4.

## Goldens

`test/golden/*.png` are human-approved, pixel-exact baselines. A golden test
that fails writes `build/<name>_candidate.png` and names both paths.

**Never re-bless a golden to make a test pass.** A failure means either an
intended visual change (inspect the candidate, confirm it is right, then bless)
or a regression (find the bug). Blessing to silence a red test destroys the only
protection the rendering has. `text_sample.png` is Literata body text: if it
changes and you did not mean to touch body rendering, stop.

Inspecting a candidate means **looking at the pixels and saying what you see**,
including whatever looks wrong in a change you go on to bless. An icon has passed
review twice while reading as the letters "OC". When a change is meant to move
only some class of pixel — edges, say — the strongest check is to prove that
nothing outside that class moved, per pixel, rather than to eyeball the totals.

Home's four goldens are two-level renders of `Plane::Bw`, via
`golden::checkGolden`, because Home takes the default `Fidelity::Mono`. Both
golden tests assert that fidelity before naming the plane, so a change to the
shipped path fails the test rather than leaving the goldens quietly pinning a path
nothing paints. `golden::checkGoldenGray` composes two planes into a 4-level image
and is for a screen on the grayscale path; nothing uses it today.

**The check that made the last two re-blesses trustworthy** was not a visual one:
compose `Plane::Lsb` and `Plane::Msb` into the 4-level coverage map (that map's
level per pixel *is* the coverage the renderer computed), then assert that **no
pixel of coverage 0 or 3 moved**. Both re-blesses came out at exactly zero, which
proves the header band, every rule, the cover's dither block, the progress bar,
the inverted block and row fields and every hint-slot position are bit-identical,
without needing to trust an eyeball on 384000 pixels. Note the level→byte mapping
is `0..3 → white..black`, so **byte 170 is coverage 1 and byte 85 is coverage 2** —
easy to get backwards, and it inverts the conclusion if you do.

## Where to look

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-20-v1-roadmap.md` — phases, and two sections
worth reading before starting anything: "What Phase 2A-2 established" and the
on-device bring-up findings.
